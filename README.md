JavaFX application designed to handle and manage a small-medium sized football league. Created as coursework piece for CS Degree. 

Ovarall marks available for application: __60__

Overall marks achieved for application: __57__

## Application Brief
Implement an application that deals with a football league (or any other sport of your choice - it could even
be a quiz night). The program should be able to record details of the teams, including information about
results of games played - it could use a simple points system, with points being recorded for a particular
team after a game. The system should be capable of producing a table to show the order of the teams.

## Marking Criteria for Application:
#### Application
* Adherence to specification
* User interface
* Input validation
* Complexity

#### Minimum Criteria
The following criteria indicate the minimum that must be achieved in order to obtain a mark within a
particular range.

Please note that meeting the criteria below does not guarantee a mark in that range. However, you
cannot obtain a mark in a particular range without meeting the criteria.

__To obtain a mark of 15 or over in this section you must:__
* Produce an application that meets the basic requirements of the system.
* Enable your data to be saved as a permanent record, using the file handling techniques that
you will learn about in week 6. You can chose any form of encoding that you wish (text,
binary, object) and you can choose whether to use serial or random access.
* Although you will not cover this topic until week 6, you can nonetheless start your
assignment well before this. You can begin your design and initial coding and the add
the file storage facility at a later date.

__Additionally, to obtain a mark of 25 or over in this section you must:__

* Produce an application consisting of at least two classes that you have created.

__Additionally, to obtain a mark of 30 or over in this section you must:__

* Demonstrate some degree of input validation.

__Additionally, to obtain a mark of 35 or over in this section you must:__

* Provide a graphical interface that has been created using JavaFX.

__Additionally, to obtain a mark of 40 or over in this section or above you must:__

* Provide significant original features not outlined in the specification.
* Clearly demonstrate how particular problems have been solved by the use of original
algorithms.
